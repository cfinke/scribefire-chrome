ScribeFire is a full-featured blog editor that integrates with your browser and lets you easily post to all of your blogs.

You can post to blogs from WordPress, Blogger, TypePad, Windows Live Spaces, Xanga, LiveJournal, or any other blog that supports the MetaWeblog or MovableType APIs.

You can edit and update existing posts. You can schedule posts for the future (if your blog allows that). You can delete posts. You can save drafts. You can tag and categorize.

ScribeFire Next has an interface so simple that even a caveman could use it. Anything you're working on is saved if you close the editor and restored when you come back. It really is the easiest way to update your blog.
